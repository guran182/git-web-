I'm from a Subversion background and when you had a branch, you knew what you were working on with "These working files point to this branch". But with Git I'm not sure when I am editing a file in NetBeans or Notepad++, whether it's tied to the master or another branch.

There's no problem with git in bash, it tells you what you're doing.
